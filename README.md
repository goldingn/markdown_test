markdown test
=============

This is a first go at using pandoc features to produce scientific documents in markdown. There's a tutorial I wrote to teach myself some bits and pieces and in case I forget how to do things. I've stuck it up here in case it's of use to anyone, but it wasn't really written for public consumption and certainly isn't a general introduction to markdown.
